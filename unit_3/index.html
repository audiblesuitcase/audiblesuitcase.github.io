<p id="slogan"> Where music meets literature.</p>

<p>Music means so much to others due its reminiscent nature. The variables as to why music is so experience driven are endless: The jam from the confused teenage days, a love song that relentlessly reminds of the ex-girlfriend, the background track that friends mingled to on the lake house that one special weekend, the coffee shop song that incomprehensibly made you think of someone or something.</p>
